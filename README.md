Hello, all. I am new to programming. They say it's never to late to learn. I am starting in C, and quickly learning that I should be multi-lingual. I have always been fascinated with computers and I remember them before windows came about. Please any help, recommendations, and guidance is greatly appreciated. I am excited to meet and work with all of you.
Thanks for reading....me!
